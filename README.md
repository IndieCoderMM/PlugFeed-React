# Plug Feed - React Challenge

> A frontend exercise from [react-take-home](https://github.com/reallabs/react-take-home)

This project aims to recreate the main offer feed of [**The Plug**](https://www.plugco.in/), which is used by influencers to access offers, track earnings and manage their accounts.

## Live Demo

## Challenge

**Time Frame: 4 Hr**

The main goal was to build the mobile UI for the main feed using JSON data from the sample API endpoint.

- Communicate with API and receive JSON data ‚úî
- Render the data according to the provided Figma design ‚úî
- Create a seamless user experience similar to **The Plug** app ‚úî
- Handle failed API requests ‚úî
- Create UI for failed state ‚è≥
- Implement inline video playback ‚úî
- Optimize load time ‚è≥
- Optimize scroll performance ‚è≥

*Some features marked with ‚è≥ couldn't be implemented due to time limitation, but I plan to add them soon*

## Stack

This project is built with React. The main technologies used are:
- Create React App: To set up the project
- Fetch API: To get JSON data from API endpoint
- `prop-types` : Library for validating props during development
- `react-icons` : Rich and simple icon library
- `gh-pages`: To deploy on GitHub Pages

## Implementation

This app follows the following implementation details:

- **Data Fetching:** The app fetches data from the API when it starts. If the API request is successful, the data is used for rendering the content.

- **Component Structure:** The main components used in the app are:
  -  `Campaign` component - responsible for displaying each item in the feed
  -  `Media` component - handle each media object within a campaign item

- **Media Actions:** Each media item within a campaign has two buttons associated with it. One button allows the user to copy the track link, while the other button enables them to download the media content.

- **Video Playback:** Play button is displayed for video media items. When the play button is clicked, the video is played inline within the app.
